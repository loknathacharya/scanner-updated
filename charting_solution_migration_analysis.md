fig.add_trace(go.Candlestick(...), row=1, col=1)

# TradingView Lightweight Implementation
st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)

# New TradingView Implementation
chart = st.lightweight_chart(
    data=data,
    type='candlestick',
    volume=True,
    indicators=['sma', 'ema', 'rsi'],
    theme='dark',
    height=600
)
```

## Migration Challenges and Solutions

### Technical Challenges

#### 1. Data Format Compatibility
**Challenge**: TradingView expects specific data format
```python
# Current Format (Plotly)
{'date': '2023-01-01', 'open': 100, 'high': 105, 'low': 98, 'close': 102}

# Required Format (TradingView)
{'time': 1672531200, 'open': 100, 'high': 105, 'low': 98, 'close': 102}
```

**Solution**: Create data transformation utility
```python
def transform_data_for_tradingview(df):
    """Transform DataFrame to TradingView format"""
    result = df.copy()
    result['time'] = pd.to_datetime(result['date']).astype('int64') // 10**9
    return result[['time', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']]
```

#### 2. Indicator Integration
**Challenge**: Different indicator calculation methods
**Solution**: Maintain existing indicator calculations, only change visualization

#### 3. Layout Migration
**Challenge**: Subplot layouts need reimplementation
**Solution**: Use TradingView's pane system for multi-panel layouts

### Implementation Challenges
