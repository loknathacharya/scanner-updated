# Stock Scanner Application Migration: Streamlit to React + FastAPI

## Overview

This document summarizes the successful migration of the Stock Scanner application from a Python + Streamlit architecture to a modern Python + React architecture. The application maintains all its original functionality while providing a more responsive and scalable user interface.

## Architecture Changes

### Original Architecture (Streamlit)
- Single Python application using Streamlit for UI
- All logic and UI in one codebase
- Limited interactivity and customization options

### New Architecture (React + FastAPI)
- **Frontend**: React application with Material-UI components
- **Backend**: FastAPI REST API server
- **Data Processing**: Original Python modules (preserved and enhanced)
- **Communication**: HTTP/JSON API between frontend and backend

## Key Components

### Backend (FastAPI)
Located in the `backend/` directory:
- REST API endpoints for all application functionality
- File upload and processing
- Data filtering (both simple and JSON-based)
- Filter management (save, load, delete)
- Integration with existing Python modules for data processing

### Frontend (React)
Located in the `frontend/` directory:
- Modern, responsive user interface
- Three main views:
  1. **File Upload**: Upload and process OHLCV data files
  2. **Filter Builder**: Create and apply filters using multiple methods:
     - Template filters
     - Custom filter builder
     - JSON filter editor
  3. **Results**: View filtered results with sorting, pagination, and export options
- Material-UI components for consistent, professional appearance
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher
- npm 6 or higher

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
   - API documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install Node dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Using the Application
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Use the "Upload Data" tab to upload a CSV, Excel, or Parquet file with OHLCV data
3. Switch to the "Build Filters" tab to create and apply filters
4. View results in the "Results" tab
5. Export results as CSV or JSON from the results tab

## Features Preserved from Original Application

All features from the original Streamlit application have been preserved and enhanced:

- File upload support for CSV, Excel, and Parquet formats
- Automatic column detection for OHLCV data
- Technical indicator calculations (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- Multiple filter types:
  - Template filters for common use cases
  - Custom filter builder with dynamic UI
  - JSON filter editor for complex conditions
- Date range filtering
- Filter saving and management
- Results display with sorting and pagination
- Data export capabilities (CSV, JSON)
- Summary statistics and data quality reports

## Additional Enhancements

The new architecture provides several enhancements over the original:

- **Improved User Experience**: Modern, responsive UI with better organization
- **Better Performance**: Decoupled architecture allows for independent scaling
- **Enhanced Customization**: Easier to modify and extend UI components
- **API-First Design**: Enables integration with other applications or services
- **Code Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- **Testing Capabilities**: Comprehensive test suite for both frontend and backend

## Testing

The migration includes a comprehensive test suite to verify functionality:

1. `test_backend.py` - Tests individual backend API endpoints
2. `integration_test.py` - Tests the complete data flow from upload to filtering
3. `comprehensive_test.py` - Verifies the complete integration of frontend and backend

All tests pass successfully, confirming that the migration has maintained full functionality.

## Troubleshooting

### CORS Issues
If you encounter CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when running the application, make sure the FastAPI backend has CORS middleware configured to allow requests from the React frontend. The backend should include:

```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3001"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

This configuration allows the frontend running on ports 3000 or 3001 to communicate with the backend on port 8000.

## Conclusion

The migration from Streamlit to React + FastAPI has been successfully completed. The application now offers a modern, responsive user interface while preserving all original functionality. The decoupled architecture provides better scalability, maintainability, and opportunities for future enhancements.

## Post-Migration Fixes

During testing, we identified and fixed two important issues:

1. **CORS Configuration**: Updated the FastAPI backend to allow requests from the React frontend running on port 3002 by adding it to the allowed origins list.

2. **Null Pointer Exception**: Fixed a runtime error in the FilterBuilder component where `processedData.map()` was being called when `processedData` was `null`. We added a check to ensure `processedData` is an array before trying to map over it.

These fixes ensure the application runs smoothly without errors.

The application is ready for production use and can be easily deployed to cloud platforms or on-premises servers.
